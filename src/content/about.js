const about = [
	"I'm a passionate and creative software developer who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js) with a keen interest in design. I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.",
	"I began my journey as a software developer in 2017, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Currently, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as NextJS, TypeScript, NestJS, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI and much more.",
	"When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, baking cookies, crocheting, jamming out to Taylor Swift, or trying out the newest cafes in the city.",
